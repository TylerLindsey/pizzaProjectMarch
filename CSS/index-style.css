/* 

NEED TO FINISH
- none of the a tags on contact us are properly selected
-go though and add explanations for codes
-VIDEO NEEDS TO HAVE IT'S NATURAL SIZE INPUT INTO CSS
  iframe{
    width: 560;
    height: 315;
   } use that to help with the video but it's not working
-THE PHONE NUMBER IS OFF TO THE LEFT ON THE HOME PAGE, AT 25% MARGIN ON THE MENU/CONTACT AND NOT THERE ON MENU ITEMS
-STYLE THE MENU-ITEMS ABOVE 600<!!!! THE IMAGES ARE TOO SMALL. Just copy the contactUs style, already did it to pizza (then it stopped working)
-the contactUs page is splitting into 3 columns at about 1055 wide
-for some reason the phione number disappears on food item pages
-fix the nav bar and phone number to be centered, not margin 25%, it just sort of works for now but needs to be fixed. Review positioning w4a to fix the problems with the nav bar and phone number at the top of the screen. Also style it a little bit better
-make the nav bar appear in the top corner on desktop like standard websites have
