/* DO NOT LINK API KEY!!!!!!!!!!

where i left off
-I started the 40 year animation and have it commented out in the 40year.scss and also in index.html I commented out the sun picture and created the body for the animation. I just commented it out for now
-first thing i should do is back up a copy to github of what i have, go from there, the things i have listed below can basically be done in order/chronologically.

all i have left for mobile is to:
-fix git
-organize files in explorer by sass, html 
-WHAT DOES 24 ITEMS ACTUALLY MEAN FOR THE ASSIGNMENTS REQUIREMENTS?????? See below in if i have time section
-is there supposed to be the <and> on line 2 of min600?
-I designed my tablet version by changing the view to only 390 tall, to simulate a phone going into tablet mode. Is that always going to work for design? or would it be better to keep it full height? 
-did i do the twitter card correct?, and on that note, how can i do them better for seo?
-why is my 40 year animation not working? I can copy paste the code out of the site in and it "works" (Not styled right but it works). But right now I keep getting errors, actually even when i copy paste certain elemtents in at a time

review
-positioning w4a to fix the problems with the nav bar and phon number at the top of the screen. I may also want to make the font smaller?
-change absolute units to relative so that it scales to device size. (except the really small stuff) and use % for children/parents

MAKE SURE I MAKE IT NOT CLICKABLE ON DESKTOP/TABLET 
MAKE THE EMAIL US LINK LOOK DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER PAGE LINKS
-use float to wrap text around images like in word.

problems i have to fix
-my paragraphs are going out on the mobile still, so i need to fix that
- i have to center the nav bar. its not a problem on mobile really but is off to the left on tablet
  - i have to do the same thing to the phone number at the top of the page
- on desktop (1024x768) I want to change the entire layout to not be a list, but instead be a grid 

if i can/have time
-give the number and nav a relative position so that i can add space to any of the 4 sides
use an absolute position for the animations over the images (can apply to food and to home page gallery) -> coud be an alternative to the "hidden menu"
-add the "hidden menu" and navigation for things like specific type of pizza -> maybe leave until I complete everything and either add that as a cool feature, or back up plan is to just make a cell for every item (that's not as cool, but time management) 
    could make it so that the "hidden menu" just pops up over what is already working and displays the different types of food? like pizza types and beer brands? 
        WHAT DOES 24 ITEMS ACTUALLY MEAN FOR THE ASSIGNMENTS REQUIREMENTS??????
-style nav bar
-make 40 year animation https://www.codingflicks.com/2020/11/pure-css-number-counter.html teaches how to do a digit counter. 
-https://www.proglobalbusinesssolutions.com/css-hover-effects/ for ideas to implement
-popup that looks like an incoming facetime is effective. I saw this at https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/types-procrastination-and-how-you-can-fix-them.html about halfway down the page it just pops out

formula to make users know there is more (especally horizontal scrolling)
so set all of the widths(or heights) of a particular section so that the sum is between 80-90% of the screen, then there is always 10-20% of the next section on the screen, so the user knows it is there.
